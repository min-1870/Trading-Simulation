Although I am not an expert in the trading market, I started this project to identify data patterns using Tensorflow and brute force. I collected data from Binance and created six types of moving average calculators, including SMA, EMA, TEMA, and RSL.

To start, I collected data from Binance, a popular cryptocurrency exchange. I then created six different types of moving average calculators, including SMA, EMA, TEMA, and RSL. These calculators helped me to better understand the data and identify any patterns that might exist.

My first approach was to look for the "golden cross" through different moving averages. This is a common strategy used by traders to identify potential buy signals. By looking at different moving averages and how they intersect.

My second approach was to use pattern recognition through Tensorflow. Tensorflow is a powerful machine learning tool that can identify patterns and make predictions based on data. I used Tensorflow to analyze the data and identify any patterns that might exist. This allowed me to make more informed trading decisions and potentially increase my profits.
